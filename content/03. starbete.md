Project plan:
Background:
People in rural areas tend to have a higher morbidity and accumulation of risk factors than their counterparts in urban communities. (1, 2, 3, 4).  Healthcare providers as well as patients who live in these areas are challenged by the pure distance from each other. 
Digital solutions such as applications on mobile phones are in theory on their way to change that. New high-speed internet connections via LTE, which started in Sweden 2009, and the upcoming 5G standard and HD cameras in mobile phones make it possible to connect with people even beyond the reach of the electric grid (5).
In the Swedish county Dalarna started 2019 as public healthcare provider its own digital application in which patients could contact a GP without the need physical meeting. 
In other parts of Sweden it was shown the exactions, that especially patients with a high morbidity would benefit the most from this new development, may differ from the outcome (6). However this might not be true for the rural areas.

In the literature the definition of “rural” itself is quite inconsistent (7), often referred to as areas with less than 100-150 inhabitants per square kilometer. According to the Swedish statistic agency, Sweden has about 25 inhabitants per square kilometer (8, 9) indicating that Sweden is mainly rural. This study will use the definition of the Swedish rural medicine society which considers only the 4 healthcare providing units Särna, Sälen, Malung and Vansbro as rural (10). The references may differ from this definition. 
The morbidity will be classified by the evidence-based Johns Hopkins ACG®-system, which is especially used in primary care (11). The system allows to quantifying morbidity by core-data, such as age, gender and diagnosis in a specific period of time (12). 

Purpose:
This retrospective study will investigate if and how the morbidity of healthcare searching patients (patient groups) may differ between those who are visiting a regularly rural healthcare unit compared to those who use the digital application “Min vård”. 
Questions:
Differ “digital” patients from “physical” patients in the aspect of morbidity? If yes, in which aspects?
Differ rural patients from urban patients in the aspect of morbidity? If yes, in which aspects?
Differ “digital” rural patients from “digital” urban patients in the aspect of morbidity? If yes, in which aspects?




Method: 
This will be a retrospective register study.
The study population will include all patients above the age 21 that used the application “Min vård” in 2019. Furthermore the listed patients of the healthcare units in Särna, Sälen, Malung and Vansbro and Britsarvet in 2019. 
The data for the “digital” patients will be provided by the applications provider. With the journal system TakeCare the patients will be matched to their regular healthcare unit. Age, gender and all diagnoses in 2019 will be extracted. This will be done via TakeCare and the connected analytic software BILD and MedRave. The same procedure will be applied to the listed patients of the earlier mentioned healthcare units.
Then the anonymized data will be analyzed with the Johns Hopkins ACG®-system V10.0. Which allows grouping the patients in morbidity groups.
After this a statistical analysis (Mann-Whitney U test) of the ACG values with the program SPSS can be done . 

Ethical aspects:
This study has to be approved by the heads of the digital healthcare units as well as the physical ones. The patient data has to be anonymized.
The integrity of the individual will be protected firstly by anonymizing, secondly by transforming individual diagnosis to morbidity groups for analysis end lastly by analyzing on a group level. 

Time schedule: 
January 2020: Acceptance of study format
February to June 2020: Gathering the necessary approvals and data
July and August 2020: Analyzing the data and writing the study
